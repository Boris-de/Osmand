//	    == Osmand application (TODO 126) ==

//		=== Refactoring issues ===
//		|| 116 || Move all messages.properties related Android application inside strings.xml to have better access with their translation ||
//	    || 125 || Introduce service layer rather than singletons and put all related into new package (services). Review architecture. Split some big classes. ||
		
		
//		=== Common issues ===
//	    || 124 || Animated transition using only raster images (?) - skip animations (!) - don not render vectoring for animations ||
//      || 123 || Improve gpx file showing (very slow for big files) ||
//      || 122 || Frozen sqlite db images (bug?). When images are loaded into sqlite the whole map is frozen || 	
//      || 121 || Filter network location from GPS location (wait for 10 seconds before start using network location) ||
//      || 120 || Show icons over poi circle ||
//      || 119 || Dialog on main screen tips and tricks ||
//      || 118 || Config switching between maps on different zoom levels <14 (using raster), > 14 vector ||
//      || 117 || Share location (send/get location from SMS, email) - Issue ||	
//		|| 112 || Investigate exiting/minimizing app (Issue) ||
//		|| 97 || For voice navigation consider current speed of vehicle. Especially when speed > 50 pronounce more than 200 m ||
//		|| 104 || Add activity to show current loaded indexes and information about them ||
//		|| 86 || Allow to add/edit custom tags to POI objects (Issue) ||
//		|| 92 || Support poi index with standard map index and unify POI categories (unify done +, works very slow) ||
//		|| 96 || Introduce settings for MPH, imperial units ||
//		|| 113 || Calculate speed cameras/bumps on the road (announce about them) ||
//		|| 110 || Use android voice for pronounce command (could be used in future to pronounce street) (Issue) ||	
//		|| 111 || Investigate showing street name while driving (Issue) ||	
//		|| 86 || Allow to add/edit custom tags to POI objects (Issue) ||
//		|| 96 || Introduce settings for MPH, imperial units (Issue) ||

	
//		=== Not clear if really needed (Means golden ratio complexity/necessity) ===
//		|| 66 || Transport routing (show next stop, total distance, show stop get out, voice) ||
//		|| 85 || Enable on/off screen for bike navigation ||
//		|| 83 || Add monitoring service to send locations to internet ||
	
	
//		=== Unscheduled (complex) ===
//		|| 65 || Intermediate points - for better control routing, to avoid traffic jams ...(?) ||

	// 	_19. colors for road trunk and motorway
