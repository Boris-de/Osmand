	// Not clear if it is really needed 
	//   69. Add phone information to POI
	//   70. Show building numbers over map (require changing address index - index 2 more columns lat/lon for fast search)

	//   63. Support simple offline routing(require new index file) (?)

	
	// TODO swing
	// 9. Fix issues with big files (such as netherlands) - save memory (!) - very slow due to transport index !
	// Current result : for big file (1 - task  60-80% time, 90% memory) (?)
 	// ! 10. Improve address indexing (use relations). (?) // SLOBODSKAYA 157, 95
    //	  use relation "a6" (to accumulate streets!),  "a3" to read all cities & define boundaries for city (& define that street in city).
